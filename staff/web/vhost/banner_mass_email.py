The OCF staff noticed that your group's website [1] does not have the "Hosted
by OCF" banner required by the virtual hosting rules [2]. All student group
websites are required to display the "Hosted by OCF" banner as well as the
student group disclaimer. Unfortunately, if you do not add both of them, we
will be forced to disable your website to comply with the university's
requirements. Please add both sometime within the next 3 weeks (by May 24) to
prevent disabling of your website. Thanks for your cooperation and good luck
on finals.

Your username is {name}.

If you've forgotten how to login, instructions can be found here [3]. If
you've forgotten your password, you can reset it here [4].

Thanks for flying OCF,
The friendly staff of 171 MLK Student Union
